        <p>This page explains why miniatures games are my favorite type of tabletop game. While there are several types of tabletop games that I enjoy, nothing compares to minaitures games to me. I love assembling and painting miniatures just as much as I enjoy using them in games. My favorite type of minaitures games are skrimish games, where you only need a handful of individual miniatures to play the game. Below is a list of some of my favorite skirmish games:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warcry</li>
            <li>Kings of War: Vanguard</li>
            <li>Necromunda</li>
            <li>Kill Team</li>
            <li>Frostgrave</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These games are all great examples of fun skimrish games, but there are countless others out there to explore. If you have an interest in modelling, painitng, or wargaming, I'd highly recommend trying out a skirmish miniatures game!</p>
